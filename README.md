# Machine Learning, Project Ebola

### Setup:

To run our notebooks, the installation of a number of libraries is required. 
First, basic libraries for scientific computing and data manipulation:
  - csv
  - numpy
  - panda
  
Then, libraries for data visualization:
  - matplotlib
  - graphviz
  - seaborn

Finally, libraries for statistics and machine learning: 
  - statsmodels
  - sklearn
  - yellowbrick
 
With the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) the installation of the latest version of one of the libraries is done by this way:
```sh
$ pip install SomePackage
```
Some third-party distributions also provide versions of most of these libraries, integrated with their package-management systems. 
For example, to install a package with anaconda:
```sh
$ conda install SomePackage
```
For further information go to  [docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/fr/3.6/installing/index.html). 

### Installation:

The git repository contains two folders:
- `study_EIXUZQ`
- `study_EGOYQN`

For each of the two studies, the distribution of the files is as follows. 
    
    ├── ...
        ├── study_EIXUZQ                  
        │   ├──   
        │   ├──     
        │   └── 
        ├── study_EGOYQN  
        │   ├── 
        │   └── 
        ├── IDDO _data
        └── README.md
    
Running the notebooks in each study will recreate our best predictions, however it needs access to the data from the EPFL/MLO-IDDO collaborative project.
Therefore, please insert the following .csv data files into the `DDO _data` folder.
